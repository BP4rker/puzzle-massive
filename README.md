# Puzzle Massive

A Massively Multiplayer Online Jigsaw Puzzle as a web application.  Jigsaw
puzzles are made from randomly generated classic interlocking pieces and can be
5000+ pieces.  Players can collaborate on the same jigsaw puzzle in real time.
Other player's piece movements are moderated automatically in order to prevent
abusive behavior.

**A live version is hosted at [puzzle.massive.xyz](http://puzzle.massive.xyz).**

Bugs and feature requests can be tracked via the projects source code repository
https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive/issues
or send an email to puzzle-bug@massive.xyz with a description.

This project has been moved to GitHub with a fresher git commit history. The
previous git commit history is available upon request.  I've chosen to make
Puzzle Massive an open source project under the GNU Affero General Public
License.

More documentation is available within the docs directory.

* [Local development guide](docs/development.md) for getting a local version
    running on your own machine.
* [Deployment guide](docs/deployment.md) for deploying to a live server. This
    covers both in-place deployments and blue-green deployments.

The structure of this project inherits from this

## Getting Help

I try to monitor the chat channels on the [Discord server for Puzzle
Massive](https://discord.gg/uVhE2Kd).  This project is slightly complex with
a few moving pieces (pun intended); that being said, there is a good chance that
a piece or two are missing when putting the project together.  If you have ran
into a problem getting this project working on your own machine; please ask for
help.  I'm looking to improve the process where I can and am looking for more
experience helping others in web development stuff like this.
