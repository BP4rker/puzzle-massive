  Add an empty puzzle instance slot to your account. These allow you to create
  copies of existing puzzles that you can control. A puzzle instance has the
  extra ability to be frozen by the owner that created it. Freezing a puzzle
  instance will prevent anyone from moving pieces on that puzzle until you
  unfreeze it. This allows you to work on that puzzle whenever you want without
  worrying that someone else will finish it before you do.
</p>

<p>
  A puzzle instance can also be removed from one of your puzzle instance slots.
  Doing so will allow you to create a new puzzle instance from any other
  existing puzzle and set the pieces count for it.
</p>

<p>
  Puzzle Instance Slots are available for sale at the
  <a href="https://puzzle-massive.square.site/"
    >Puzzle Massive store hosted on Square</a
  >. It can take a day or so to manually assign them to your player account
  after purchase. I plan to automate this better in the future.
</p>

<p>
  Send me an e-mail at jake@weboftomorrow.com if you have questions when buying
  a Puzzle Instance Slot. Or sponsor my open source work on the
  <a href="https://github.com/jkenlooper/puzzle-massive"
    >Puzzle Massive project</a
  >
  and I'll assign one to you as a thank you.
