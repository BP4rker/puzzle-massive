  The online store for Puzzle Massive will feature shippable products as well as
  digital ones.
  <strong>At the moment, the online store is not quite ready.</strong> There are
  a few other things that need to be finished before it is available.
  <a href="#buystuff-support-sponsors">Sponsors of Puzzle Massive</a> are listed
  below and have awesome and unique things to buy.

<p>
  Please contact me if you'd be interested in buying something that is related
  to Puzzle Massive in the future. I'm open to ideas of what to sell here in
  order to support the project and further development.

<h2 id="buystuff-puzzle-instance-slots">Puzzle Instance Slots</h2>

<p>
  Add an empty puzzle instance slot to your account. These allow you to create
  copies of existing puzzles on the web site that you control. A puzzle instance
  has the extra ability to be frozen by the owner that created it. Freezing a
  puzzle instance will prevent anyone from moving pieces on that puzzle until
  you unfreeze it. This allows you to work on that puzzle whenever you want
  without worrying that someone else will finish it before you do.
</p>

<p>
  A puzzle instance can also be removed from one of your puzzle instance slots.
  Doing so will allow you to create a new puzzle instance from any other
  existing puzzle and set the pieces count for it.
</p>

<p>
  For now puzzle instance slots are not available for sale through an online
  store checkout system. This is a planned feature, but there are few other
  features that need to happen first. Please contact me if you are interested in
  buying a puzzle slot.
