<h2>Puzzle Instance Slots</h2>

<p>Add an empty puzzle instance slot to your account.  These allow you to create
  copies of existing puzzles on the web site that you control.  A puzzle
  instance has the extra ability to be frozen by the owner that created it.
Freezing a puzzle instance will prevent anyone from moving pieces on that puzzle
until you unfreeze it.  This allows you to work on that puzzle whenever you want
without worrying that someone else will finish it before you do.</p>

<p>A puzzle instance can also be removed from one of your puzzle instance slots.
  Doing so will allow you to create a new puzzle instance from any other
  existing puzzle and set the pieces count for it.</p>

<p>For now puzzle instance slots are not available for sale through an online
  store checkout system.  This is a planned feature, but there are few other
  features that need to happen first.  Please contact me if you are interested
  in buying a puzzle slot.
