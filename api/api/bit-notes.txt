    last_viewed: timestamp updates each time the expiration is updated.
    This way all icons should cycle evenly.

User
    no changes except to drop the icon column.  Will use a join to get the
    BitIcon:name which will replace it. This will also prevent multiple users
    from having the same icon.

Store bit icon images in ui/media/bit-icons/ (remove the symlink to /puzzle/static/images/bit-icons/)
TODO: How to handle bit icon uploads in the future?

BitIcon expiration?
    When player earns a point update the expiration date of the bit icon accordingly.
    If score is less then 5; the expiration date is set only an hour in advance for each point.
    less than 5: update expiration to 1 hour
    less than 15: update expiration to 10 hours
    less than 25: update expiration to 2 days
    less than 35: update expiration to 3 days
    ...
    more then 453 and less then lowest top score: update expiration to 5 months


UPDATE BitIcon SET
expiration = (SELECT datetime('now', ( SELECT be.extend FROM BitExpiration AS be JOIN BitIcon AS b JOIN User AS u ON u.id = b.user WHERE u.score > be.score AND u.id = 3 ORDER BY be.score DESC LIMIT 1
)))
WHERE user = 3;
SELECT u.id, b.name AS icon, u.score, u.m_date,
b.expiration FROM BitIcon AS b
JOIN User AS u ON u.id = b.user
WHERE u.id = 3
;
