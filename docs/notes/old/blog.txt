Initial Status
--------------

Version: 0.0.1

I started this project on Feb. 18 2011 and today is the 26th.  The total hours
spent developing it has been 15 hours creating the renderer and 16 hours on
just developing all the code.  Granted, I was able to make use of the wot
package to handle some of the web framework stuff.  Also I was able to modify
some of my code I wrote for the 404 countdown script which handles moving
pieces around.  Ends up that bit of code was probably the hardest to fix some
of the issues on.  Originally I took it from the example friendfeed chat code
that tornado provides.  Heavily modified of course so instead of sending text
messages to listeners I'm sending instructions to the polling javascript that
tells the pieces to move around.  

Some major accomplishments:
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
  
  * Creating the svg for a puzzle piece.
  * Randomizing the svg path for each side of the piece.
  * Using imagemagick commands to 'cut' the piece out of a picture.
  * Figuring out how to handle the dimensions of pieces, versus size of image.
  * Creating the initial website that just has an upload form and lists all the
    puzzles that have been rendered.
  * Writing the page request handlers to allow piece movement and sending that
    to other 'listeners'.
  * Stress testing with a 'test order' and 'test random' buttons that move pieces around.

The max size so far that I've tested is at 30000 pieces (2,961 adjusted) which
was set to make each piece div about 30x30 pixels square. My slow computer took
a while to manually move a piece when there are that many on screen. A slight
delay after mouse clicks and drags. The test scripts handle moving pieces just
fine, tho. As I haven't taken the time to really try to put a puzzle together
with that many pieces, but it seems that it could be possible.

Currently working on now
++++++++++++++++++++++++

I've started to create the joining piece logic.  This will rely on the idea
that pieces can be parents.  Then their x,y will be relative to the parent.
All pieces initially don't have a parent so their x,y is relative the
puzzle-container.

On the website this structure will be shown as a 'group' div containing all the
pieces that are a child of a parent piece. the group div will move around with
any containing piece movements. Hmm... on thinking this through, the 'group'
div should probably be renamed to 'family'.

Budget
++++++

Since it seems I've been obsessed with puzzle this past week; I figured it was
time to initiate a budget.  Not that it is ever easy or accurate to estimate
development time, but I think having a goal in mind will keep me focused.  I've
allotted 200 development hours for this initial release.  This initial release
should be something that is entertaining that I can put on a website.  By then
it will be version 1.0.0.  Hopefully I can get it tested well enough that there
aren't any major security holes...
