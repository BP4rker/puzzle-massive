      You are currently logged in anonymously for this browser.  There is no
      login or password needed in order to play as your bit icon.  This is
      based on a stored cookie on this browser and will eventually expire.
      In order to login again when your cookie expires you'll need to
      generate an <em>Anonymous Login Link</em> which you should save as
      a bookmark.  Following that link will log you back in.
      </p>
      <p>
      Click the <em>Anonymous Login Link</em> button to generate a new
      login link.  Save this link as a bookmark and use it log back in.

      <p>Note that all new players get a randomly assigned bit icon based
      on their IP address.  After a new player has joined enough pieces
      they may change their bit icon and thus save a cookie.  Then the
      below anonymous login link will apply.</p>
